# --- 1. Get User Inputs ---

# Get the main dish, remove whitespace, and convert to lowercase
main_dish = input().strip().lower()

# Get the time of day as an integer (e.g., 14 for 2 PM)
time_of_day = int(input())

# Get voucher status (expecting "true" or "false")
has_voucher = input().strip().lower() == "true"

# Get payment method (expecting "true" or "false" for card payment)
is_card_payment = input().strip().lower() == "true"


# --- 2. Calculate Initial Cost ---

# Set initial cost based on the main dish
if main_dish == "paneer tikka":
    cost = 250
elif main_dish == "butter chicken":
    cost = 240
elif main_dish == "masala dosa":
    cost = 200
else:
    # If the dish is not on the menu, print an error and exit
    print("Invalid main dish")
    exit()


# --- 3. Apply Discounts ---

# Time-based discount (12 PM to 3 PM inclusive)
# Corrected the logic from '12 <' to '12 <=' to include 12 PM
if 12 <= time_of_day <= 15:
    # Apply 15% lunch discount
    cost *= 0.85

# Voucher discount
if has_voucher:
    # Apply 10% voucher discount
    cost *= 0.9


# --- 4. Apply Surcharges ---

# Card payment service charge
if is_card_payment:
    # Calculate and add a 5% service charge
    service_charge = 0.05 * cost
    cost += service_charge


# --- 5. Print Final Cost ---

# Print the final cost formatted to 2 decimal places
# Corrected the f-string syntax
print(f"{cost:.2f}")
